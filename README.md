# RNA-seq Workshop in R

Welcome to this **RNA-seq analysis workshop**! This session introduces RNA-seq data analysis using **R** and **DESeq2**, designed for beginners who want to explore gene expression data, perform differential expression analysis, and create visualizations.

> **Important:** All work in this workshop should be done in a **Codespace**. Make sure you create a new Codespace at the start and run all commands there.

---

## Workshop Overview
In this workshop, you will learn to:
- Load and explore RNA-seq count data.
- Work with sample metadata and prepare it for analysis.
- Perform differential gene expression analysis using **DESeq2**.
- Visualize results, including volcano plots, to identify significant genes.

We focus on hands-on exercises with explanations to help you understand each step.

## Data
The following files are used:
1. **Raw counts:** `data/rawCountExpressionMatrix.txt`  
2. **Clinical metadata:** `data/Phenotypes.tsv` or `data/clinical.txt`
